/**
 * A Basic unit of operation that involves both local plugin as well as client
 * steps as part of one single operation. For example, for starting an
 * application, an operation may include all of these substeps:
 * <p/>
 * 1. Starting an operation from a UI event
 * <p/>
 * 2. Prompting the user for missing application deployment information
 * <p/>
 * 3. Sending a start request to the CF client
 * <p/>
 * 4. Checking that the application started
 * <p/>
 * 5. Firing a refresh event so listeners, like UI editors and views, can fresh
 * the state of the application in the UI
 * <p/>
 * 6. As well as handling errors and synchronizing with other background jobs
 * 
 * <p/>
 * All these steps are modeled by one operation abstraction, that may be
 * performed atomically if necessary.
