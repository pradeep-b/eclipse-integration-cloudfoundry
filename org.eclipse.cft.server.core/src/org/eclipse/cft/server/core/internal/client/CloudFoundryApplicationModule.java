/**
 * 
 * Representation of an application that either already exists in a Cloud
 * Foundry server, or is about to be pushed to a server, and contains additional
 * properties local to the plugin framework not found in a
 * {@link CloudApplication}. It contains additional Cloud Foundry information
 * like a deployment information ( {@link ApplicationDeploymentInfo} ),
 * application stats, instances, and staging that is not available from the
 * local WST {@link IModule}. A cloud foundry application module need not
 * necessarily indicate that the application exists and is deployed in a CF
 * server. Modules are also created by the framework PRIOR to deploying an app.
 * If the module has a corresponding {@link CloudApplication}, it means that the
 * module does indeed represent an actual deployed app in a CF server. In
 * addition:
 * <p/>
 * 1. A Cloud module can be external, meaning that the deployed application does
 * not have an accessible workspace project. If this is the case, generally the
 * module will also have a mapped {@link CloudApplication}, since only
 * applications that have already been deployed can ever be external. Note
 * although all external apps are apps that are deployed in a Cloud server, not
 * all deployed apps are external. "External" is not the only indication of
 * deployment, rather it is meant to indicate whether the application is linked
 * to a local, accessible workspace project.
 * <p/>
 * 2. A Cloud module can also be mapped to a local workspace project via a local
 * {@link IModule}, in which case it would not be classified as external. This
 * does NOT mean that the application is not deployed. The application may be
 * deployed in a CF server, but also have a link to a local workspace project.
 * An application may also have a link to a local workspace project, but NOT yet
 * be deployed (so it wouldn't have a mapped {@link CloudApplication}).
 * 
 * <p/>
 * The application name of this CF-aware module may differ from the module name
 * of the local WST {@link IModule}. The reason is that the module name of the
 * local WST {@link IModule} is typically the associated workspace project, if
 * the project is accessible, while the application name in the CF Application
 * Module is the user-specified CF app name, which may be different.
 * <p/>
 * To obtain the local WST module name, use {@link #getName()} or get it through
 * {@link #getLocalModule()}, although the latter may be null if no IModule
 * mapping has been created and linked by the framework. Local names may be used
 * for obtaining workspace resources, like for example the application's
 * corresponding workspace project.
 * <p/>
 * To obtain the deployed application name, use
 * {@link #getDeployedApplicationName()}.
 * <p/>
 * The application module may be shared by multiple threads, therefore changes
 * should be synchronised at the very least.
 * <p/>
 * The app module also contains a deployment information (
 * {@link ApplicationDeploymentInfo} ), which describes deployment properties of
 * the application (e.g., URLs, memory settings, etc..), as well as services
 * that are bound, or will be bound, to the application.
 * <p/>
 * If the application has already been deployed (i.e. has a corresponding
 * {@link CloudApplication}), the deployment information is kept in synch any
 * time the module mapping to a {@link CloudApplication} is changed.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: This class can be referred by the branding extension from
 * adopter so this class should not be moved or renamed to avoid breakage to
 * adopters.
